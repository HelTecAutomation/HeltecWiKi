On **October 5, 2025**– A significant communications experiment took place on the island of La Réunion in the Indian Ocean. The [**Gaulix network**](https://gaulix.fr/), a local communication system based on the [**Meshtastic**](https://meshtastic.org/) open-source protocol and LoRa technology, successfully completed its first large-scale island-wide test.

Designed to provide a vital information lifeline for residents when traditional networks fail during extreme weather events such as hurricanes, the initiative represents a major step towards community resilience. Heltec, a provider of [**LoRa devices**](https://heltec.org/product-category/lora/) and [**Lora solutions**](https://heltec.org/news-articles/), proudly supported this visionary community-led project with its hardware and technical expertise.

### **From Concept to Community: Rapid Citizen Mobilization**

While coordinated by the local MétéoR-OI association, the Gaulix project is truly powered by community participation. In just three months, the project grew from a handful of Meshtastic enthusiasts to a vibrant community of over 100 registered participants.

During the test, approximately 30 nodes were successfully activated—a milestone achievement demonstrating that disaster resilience can be rooted in local technical collaboration and citizen engagement. Heltec emphasized that its stable and reliable devices were key to supporting this grassroots effort.

### **Test Day Highlights: Distance Records and a Node in the Sky**
The test day delivered remarkable results, confirming the potential of LoRa technology even in La Réunion’s challenging terrain.

**Conquering the Mountains** - The island’s mountainous landscape poses natural communication challenges. Deploying autonomous routing nodes with enhanced endurance and antenna performance at strategic locations proved essential—a focus for the network’s next phase.

**Success of a Mobile Node** - An ultralight aircraft equipped with a standard Heltec [**T114**](https://heltec.org/project/mesh-node-t114/) device took flight from Sainte-Marie, transmitting signals over the western part of the island. Six other nodes successfully received the signal, with the furthest connection exceeding 10 kilometers—providing valuable insights for potential aerial communications during disasters.

**New Distance Record** - A ground connection of approximately 14.2 km was established between a Heltec [**T114**](https://heltec.org/project/mesh-node-t114/) in L'Étang-Salé les Hauts and a repeater node in Le Tampon, showcasing the long-range transmission power of Heltec devices in real-world conditions.

### **Learning by Doing: Hands-On Experimentation**

The test was also a learning opportunity. Participants conducted range and mesh tests around the Cité du Volcan, experimented with homemade antennas (one mounted on a pool pole!), and introduced around 20 new users to T114 devices for the first time.

Troubleshooting Meshtastic app stability on Android and iOS, and observing unexpected multi-hop routing behavior, provided valuable insights that will contribute to the community’s ongoing growth. Heltec expressed gratitude to the participants, noting that real-world feedback is a crucial source of inspiration for product optimization.

### **From Communication Resilience to Citizen Science**

At the project base in Plaine des Cafres, a Davis Vantage Pro2 weather station was installed, and the initiative was presented to numerous visitors. A local middle school teacher expressed interest in developing educational projects around the Meshtastic network and installing a weather station at her school.

This demonstrates that the Gaulix network’s impact extends beyond emergency communications, fostering local science education and community engagement. Heltec welcomed the opportunity to see its devices supporting educational initiatives and inspiring the next generation.

### **Looking Ahead: Strengthening the Network**

The Gaulix network now has eight permanent nodes and several coastal clusters, with plans to connect them using autonomous, solar-powered relays. Community feedback, such as the T114’s antenna and USB-C placement, is helping guide future design. The network is rapidly growing, showing that resilience is ultimately a human effort. Heltec thanks the MétéoR-OI association and all participants for their trust and support, and remains committed to community-driven IoT innovation worldwide.
