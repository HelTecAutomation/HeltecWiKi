# Global Shipping & Warehouse Policy
Welcome to our shipping guide! We aim to provide fast and reliable delivery worldwide. Below you will find all the necessary information about our fulfillment process, shipping methods, and customs policies.

## Address & Order Management
**Shipping Address**: You **must**provide shipping address and post code, using standard characters and numbers(Customers in Brazil, India, and Mexico must provide their mandatory local tax identification number (or equivalent ID) during checkout for customs clearance.). This ensures our courier partners can accurately process your delivery.
**Check Before Checkout**: Due to system automation and time zone differences, please double-check your cart and address before payment.
**Parcel Inspection**: Following standard courier practice, you must check the contents of your parcel before signing for your goods. We cannot be held responsible for transit damage if you sign without inspection.


## Warehouse Selection and Split Shipments

**Priority Fulfillment**
While you may select a preferred warehouse during checkout, we will always prioritize shipping your order from the nearest available warehouse to your location to minimize transit time.

**Split Shipments** If your order contains items sourced from different inventory locations (warehouses), the items will be shipped separately and will arrive in multiple packages with individual tracking numbers.

**Regional Restriction** Orders from the US Warehouse can only be shipped to the US supported states. Orders from the German Warehouse can only be shipped to the supported countries.



:::note
We utilize geographically located warehouses to offer faster shipping to key regions. If your specific location is not listed under a regional warehouse, your order will be fulfilled and shipped from our China Warehouse.
