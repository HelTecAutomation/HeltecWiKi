Welcome to our shipping and warehouse policy! We aim to provide fast and reliable delivery worldwide. Below you will find all the necessary information about our general guidence, warehouse and supported countries, and customs policies.

## General Shipping Guidance
**1. Accurate Shipping Details Required**: Please ensure your shipping address and postal/ZIP code are entered using standard English letters and numerals only. Inaccurate or non-standard formats may delay processing.


:::note
To comply with customs regulations, customers shipping to Brazil, India, Mexico, Russia, and Turkey must provide a valid local Tax ID (e.g., CPF, GSTIN, RFC, INN, etc.) at checkout. Unable to provide this will result in shipment rejection or return.

**2. Review Your Order Before Payment**:We currently do not offer a grace period for editing orders after placement — please double-check all items, quantities, and shipping details before confirming payment. Due to system automation and time zone differences, you may face with delays.


**3. Inspect Upon Delivery**: In accordance with international courier standards, we strongly recommend inspecting your package for visible damage before signing for receipt. If damage is apparent, refuse delivery or note it with the carrier. Claims for transit damage cannot be accepted if the package was signed for without documented inspection.


**4. Customs Duties and Taxes**:All import duties, taxes, customs fees, and related charges levied by your country’s government are solely the responsibility of the customer. These fees are not included in your order total and are not controlled by us.

Additionally, we are legally required to collect certain taxes (including VAT, sales tax, or withholding tax) where applicable under local law. Such amounts will be calculated and added to your order at checkout — you are responsible for their payment.



**5. Priority Fulfillment Based on Location**
While you may select a preferred warehouse during checkout, we will always prioritize shipping your order from the nearest available warehouse to your location to minimize transit time.

**6. Split Shipments** If your order contains items sourced from different inventory locations (warehouses), the items will be shipped separately and will arrive in multiple packages with individual tracking numbers and may arrive on different days.

**7. Regional Restriction** 
- Orders from the US Warehouse can only be shipped to the US supported states. 
- Orders from the German Warehouse can only be shipped to the supported countries.

:::note
If no regional warehouse supports your location, your entire order will be fulfilled and shipped from our China Global Warehouse.

**8. High Cost and Inspection Risk on Battery Goods** 
Express shipping channels for battery products incur **significantly higher shipping fees** and are subject to an **increased rate of customs inspection** due to strict aviation safety regulations.
