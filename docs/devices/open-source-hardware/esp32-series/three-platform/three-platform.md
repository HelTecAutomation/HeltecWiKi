#  ESP-IDF & PlatformIO & MicroPython Guide



ESP32 supports multiple development approaches to address different development goals and system requirements. **ESP-IDF** provides the official and most comprehensive framework for low-level control and production-ready applications, **MicroPython** enables rapid prototyping through an interactive scripting runtime, and **the Arduino framework via PlatformIO** offers a simplified development model with access to a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools. This document presents a basic example for each approach to illustrate their typical development workflows.
