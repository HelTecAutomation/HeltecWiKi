title: Wi-FI HaLow Operating Frequency
---

Available bandwidths and channels vary by regulatory region. Higher bandwidths provide higher potential throughput, while lower bandwidths improve coexistence in multi-AP deployments. When deploying multiple HaLow access points, it is recommended to use distinct channels and reduced bandwidths to minimize interference. The following table shows the supported channel frequencies for this device.
